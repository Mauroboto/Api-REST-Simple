Hello you curious!!

This is a easy and simple CRUD tasks REST-API, using Node.js and Express framewokr, I just added MongoDB by using it`s function "CONNECT" (not mongoose). I have created a server which listens on PORT 3000
and have used packages from NPM like:



NODEMON: which allows me to keep my server UP, listening every single change, and reseting the server, which makes easier to see the results of your code.



BABEL: cli, preset/env, core and polyfill. together they allows you to write the newest JavaScript code, enlabling browser compatibilty with every "older" web browser, I just used the command "BUILD", which
re write the entire code into older JavaScript code, and deploys it at a new folder called DIST.



MONGODB: Instead of using Mongoose, I decided to use this modulo for doing my CRUD, just because I need to practice my knowledge.
